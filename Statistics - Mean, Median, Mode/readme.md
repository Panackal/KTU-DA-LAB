# Statistical Measures and Mode Calculation in R

## Problem Description

This R script performs several basic statistical analyses on a dataset, including:

1. **Mean**: Calculates the average of the data.
2. **Trimmed Mean with removing missing values**: Computes the mean after removing a specified percentage of extreme values.
3. **Median**: Finds the middle value when the data is sorted.
4. **Mode**: Defines and calculates the most frequent value in the dataset using a custom function.

## Working of Trimmed mean

Using ```data <- c(12, 2, 5, 45, 4, 5, 5)``` , the trimmed mean is calculated as follows:
1. **Sort the Data**: The sorted data is ```2, 4, 5, 5, 5, 12, 45```.
2. **Apply Trim**: With ```trim = 0.2```
   - remove 20% of the values from each end. ```7 * 0.20``` = ```1.4```
   - 1.4 is rounded to 1, hence 1 value should be removed from either end. 
   - Remove ```2``` (lowest) and ```45``` (highest), leaving ```4, 5, 5, 5, 12```.
4. Calculate Mean of Remaining Values:
Mean of ```4, 5, 5, 5, 12``` is ```(4 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 12) / 5 = 6.2```.
Thus, ```mean(data, trim = 0.2)``` outputs ```6.2```.

## Output
